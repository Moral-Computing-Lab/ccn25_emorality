## Background and Concept
Understanding the nature and structural organization of emotion and morality has been a central aim for social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience. Decades of research have shown that moral and affective processes are critical for learning, memory, decision-making, and social interactions. Although theorists have long argued that emotions inform moral judgments, few neuroscientific studies have modelled or demonstrated how specific emotions (e.g., anger, disgust, compassion) undergird moral judgments of specific moral domains (e.g., harm, purity, fairness). Moreover, active debates in both affective and moral science independently continue to discuss the dimensional versus categorical basis of (moral) emotions, although collaborative efforts across both fields likely have great potential to jointly advance our understanding of the human brain. Critically, the adoption of computational models and multivariate pattern analysis in these fields provides a unified framework to compare and contrast the representational structure of emotion and morality across minds, brains, and machines. 

In an effort to kickstart these exciting collaborations, we are organizing a workshop bringing together researchers with a methodological background in computational cognitive neuroscience and a joint substantive interest in affective and moral science. This workshop will consist of a combination of 2–3 keynote lectures and 2–3 collaborative, hands-on research groups. The keynote lectures will introduce the state-of-the-art in applying computational methods to the neuroscience of emotion and morality. Research discussed will include studies decoding brain activity to predict emotion and moral judgments and the use of artificial neural networks to model brain function. Subsequent research sessions will involve group work on dedicated functional neuroimaging datasets (provided by the organizers) to advance a set of predetermined research questions at the intersection of emotion and morality. We will reserve time at the end of the workshop for groups to present their preliminary findings and ask questions. 

To increase both efficiency and engagement, two months before the conference, we will organize participants into working groups and provide necessary information on materials, software (e.g., having a working Python/MATLAB environment), and possible analysis directions via Github (all analyses will be executable on standard laptops). Our envisioned, ideal outcome of this workshop will be the continued collaboration within and across the established research groups, eventually resulting in one or two joint publications. To foster this continued collaboration, we plan to organize a follow-up, online meeting in Fall where the research groups can share and discuss their project states.

We look forward to seeing you at CCN25!
